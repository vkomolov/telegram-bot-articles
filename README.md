# App Description
The Telegram bot on "node-telegram-bot-api": "^0.63.0" manages the links of the internet resources, 
which can be stored, deleted, added to favorites by Telegram user.
If the user is the owner of the bot, he can add or delete the internet resources from
the Mongo DB just with the UI of the bot.
Other users have the access to the resources and can manage them in favorites section...
## Task: 
- To realise the bot UI in the way of the menus, which change each other without keeping sent messages...
Thus the user will be more convenient avoiding scrolling messages history in order to use
UI: the new menu replaces the previous one without a heap of messages...;
